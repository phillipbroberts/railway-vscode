name: CI

# This workflow runs on every push/PR to validate the code
# Release process:
# 1. Ensure CI is passing
# 2. Run "Bump Version" workflow to increment version and create GitHub release
# 3. Test the new version locally if needed
# 4. When ready, run "Publish to VS Code Marketplace" workflow
# This separation allows you to create versions without immediately publishing them
